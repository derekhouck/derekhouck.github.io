So, after reading [numerous](https://www.ign.com/articles/balatro-review) [glowing](https://aftermath.site/the-nerve-of-balatro-for-being-this-good) [reviews](https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame), I finally broke down and started playing [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/).

There was no question I would like this game. I am a sucker for roguelike deckbuilders. I played [Slay the Spire](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/slay-the-spire-switch/) on my Nintendo Switch for months. My favorite Android game has been [Slice & Dice](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.com.tann.dice&hl=en_US&gl=US). I even got heavily into [Hades](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/) despite it requiring reaction time skills that I simply do not possess. If you give me a randomly generated path and the ability to slowly build up skills and abilities, I'm hooked. And lordy, does Balatro ever deliver.

The graphics are nothing to write home about. In fact, they're not really appealing. It don't matter. The gameplay is so addictive, I do not notice. I don't really care for poker. Doesn't make a bit of difference. The poker is just an anchor to rest a deckbuilder upon.

It was no surprise that this game would sink its hooks into me. I knew this before I started playing it. Even knowing that, I couldn't resist. And it now takes every iota of my willpower to not play this game constantly.

If you value your time and wish to keep living a productive life, do not play Balatro. But let's be honest: You already know if you would like this game or not. You already know if you're going to play it. If you don't hold it against me, I won't hold it against you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I can make another Flush House if I just discard these four non-face cards.
