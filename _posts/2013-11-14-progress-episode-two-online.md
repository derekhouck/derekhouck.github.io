Episode two of [Progress](http://progresstheseries.com/), entitled &#8220;iFall Into Captivity,&#8221; has been unleashed upon the Internet. The government has had enough of this Internet filth and takes action to filter it.

“Progress” is a ten episode web series. Victorian England has a steam-powered internet and Jack the Ripper is posting his crimes on the web. It’s a Sherlockian cyber-thriller and a game of riddles to decipher the identity of the Whitechapel Murderer.

I portray Adam Rhett, the editor and proprietor of the controversial website “WikiPunch.” He’s a mixture of Julian Assange and the Mad Hatter, a merry prankster who revels in revealing secrets.

Enjoy!
