  Hello Friends,</p> 
  
  <p>
    I invite you all to come see me perform in Anne-Marie MacDonald&#8217;s <em class="summary">Goodnight Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet)</em>. <span class="description">Were Shakespeare&#8217;s two most famous plays actually comedies written by an unknown author? Constance Ledbelly seeks to prove her thesis when she disappears into her wastebasket and resurfaces in the worlds of Othello and Romeo & Juliet with hilarious results.</span> I play Tybalt, Juliet&#8217;s cousin and would-be slayer of Mercutio, who must confront a world where Romeo is now his cousin by marriage, revealed by a mysterious pedant.

    I can honestly say this show has something for everyone. You like sword fights? I&#8217;ve got three of the them in this show. Cross-dressing? All over the place. Lesbian kissing? Yes sir. We even speak 2/3 of the show in iambic pentameter. So come see <em>Goodnight Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet)</em> and dare to see Shakespeare&#8217;s classic characters in a whole new light. I hope to see you all there. </div>
