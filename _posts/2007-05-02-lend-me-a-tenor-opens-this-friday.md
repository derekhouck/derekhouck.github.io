Hello Friends,

&#8220;Lend Me A Tenor&#8221; by Ken Ludwig opens this Friday, May 4th at 8pm at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre in Santa Monica. It runs Fridays and Saturdays at 8pm, and Sundays at 2pm until June 2nd.

&#8220;Lend Me A Tenor&#8221; is a high-energy, door-slamming farce. Henry Saunders is delivering the American premiere of world-famous tenor Tito Merelli to the Cleveland Opera Company. Unfortunately Tito has drug overdose and Saunders&#8217; assistant Max must take his place. Can Max save Henry&#8217;s job, and will they be able to keep Tito&#8217;s body a secret?

I really hope everyone can come see this incredibly fast-paced, highly physical comedy. I play the role of the autograph-seeking Bellhop, whose only obstacle towards meeting Tito Merelli is the bad-tempered Saunders. The director, Greg Zerkle, should be well known to everyone from Costa Mesa and Simi Valley, and Simi people will also recognize our stage manager J9 running between the stage and the booth.

The Morgan-Wixson Theatre is located at 2627 Pico Blvd in Santa Monica. There is free parking at 2509 Pico Blvd. To get tickets, call 310-828-7519. The Box Office is open Wednesday through Saturday, 3pm-7pm. Thank you very much, and I hope to see you there!
