&#8220;ABSENT,&#8221; a horror short I acted in at the end of last year, has been accepted into two film festivals!

&#8220;ABSENT&#8221; will be premiering at the [Cinema City International Film Festival](http://www.cciff.com/) on Wednesday, October 1st. All screenings for the festival are held at the AMC Theaters in the Universal Citywalk and admission is free. &#8220;ABSENT&#8221; will be shown in the 2:40pm block of shorts.

&#8220;ABSENT&#8221; has also been accepted into the [Terror Film Festival](http://terrorfilmfestival.net/) in Philadelphia, PA and will be shown as part of the &#8220;Spongey Shorts&#8221; at 2:45pm on &#8220;Splatter Saturday,&#8221; October 25th.

&#8220;ABSENT&#8221; is a 20 minute horror film directed by Aaron Mento. Two high school students return to the scene of a brutal classroom suicide, but soon realize that not all is what it seems, and before the night is over, more blood will be spilled.
