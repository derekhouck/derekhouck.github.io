Derek Houck was recently interviewed by [The American Academy of Dramatic Arts](https://www.aada.edu/) Academy News regarding the invasion of [Amazon Prime Video](http://amzn.to/2fAUTDM) by&nbsp;[_Napoleon Bon Appétit_](http://napoleonbonappetit.com/). Derek talks about the inspiration behind the series, whether there will be a third season, and more. Regarding the challenges of playing Napoleon:

> **The Academy:** Do you and/or Katherine have any particular culinary background?
> 
> **Derek:** I certainly do not. Katherine was responsible for cooking all the food we used, but I don&#8217;t believe she had any special training. I also don&#8217;t speak French, and anyone who can speak French and has seen the series would certainly agree with that assertion. This naturally posed a challenge when creating the script. How do you do a cooking show with a French host when you can do neither?
> 
> My solution was to essentially make Napoleon into a culinary Charlie Chaplin. He only speaks when absolutely necessary and whenever he touches something he screws it up. It saved me from looking like a fraud and provides a lot of the comedy in the series.
