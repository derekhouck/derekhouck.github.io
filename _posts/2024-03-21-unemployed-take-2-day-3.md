On Tuesday, [Volt](https://www.textvolt.com/) let me go after less than a month working
for the company. My wife woke up with a fever. I had to work with an exterminator to get
rid of an infestation of clvoer mites. And the Frosty machine at my local Wendy's was
broken. It was not a good day.

On Wednesday, I posted about what had happened to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/derekhouck_rust-opentowork-activity-7176252664467320834-VF2c). To my suprise, the post
went viral. And let me tell you, go viral on LinkedIn is _weird_. I learned about
[Comment For Better Reach](https://blog.linkboost.co/cfbr-pros-and-cons-how-to-use-the-linkedin-commenting-for-better-reach/) through all the
[#cfbr](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=cfbr) comments added to the post.
I received hundreds of connection requests and dozens of messages from recruiters and resume coaches of
varying levels of repute. As of 10:10 am Central Time this morning, the post has over
140,000 impressions, 1,300+ reaction, 113 comments, and 69 _(nice)_ reposts.

I wish I had a clue about why this post, in particular, went viral. But I don't. I imagine
adding the [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=opentowork) hashtag
was a big part of it. But that's added to all "Open to Work" posts by default. While I
would love to say it was my eloquent writing style, there are plenty of LinkedIn members
writing just as pretty prose that are barely getting noticed. My best guess is that my
post resonated with several different groups of people who could sympathize with my
current situation. Over the course of the day, I received comments and messages from
people who had similarly transitioned from the entertainment industry to tech seeking
stability and not finding it here. I heard from other folks who had been laid off multiple
times within the past year, nine months, six months. And most heart-breaking of all, I
read stories from other intended parents whose IVF and surrogacy journies were jeopardized
by issues out of their control. It was simultaneously reassuring and saddening to learn
just how much I am not alone in this particular struggle. I hope everyone who interacted
with that post yesterday finds a job and career that is stable, fulfilling, and allows
them to live the life they've been yearning for.

It is now Thurday, March 21st, 2024. There are several employment lawyers in Oklahoma I
need to call today. I have to find a box and ship back my Volt laptop. And I'm about to
meet with my _[Never Search Alone](https://www.phyl.org/)_ Job Search Council for the
first time since this unemployment sequel began. I'm gonna try and document my journey
this time around. I hope I can look back on these posts in a year or two with a job,
a child, and confidence in the future. Talk to you all soon.
