The trailer is up for [_Lucky 13_](https://www.facebook.com/Lucky13series), a web series that tells the story of the trials, tribulations, and life lessons of eight strangers who all make their way to Los Angeles to pursue their dreams of “making” it in Hollywood. Although they are from varied places and backgrounds, these actors find themselves thrown together and are forced to learn that they have more in common than they think. The bonds formed through their hopeful, victorious, and sometimes tragic experiences prove to be life-long. As they embark on the up hill climb of pursuing their passions, they realize that in order to grow as an artist… they must first grow as individuals.
