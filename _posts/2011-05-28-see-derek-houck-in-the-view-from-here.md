The reviews are out for the West Coast premiere of [&#8220;The View From Here,&#8221;](https://www.facebook.com/TheViewFromHereLA) and they like what they&#8217;re seeing. The [Tolucan Times](http://tolucantimes.info/section/theatre_review/misery-loves-company-in-the-view-from-here/) calls it a &#8220;compelling story&#8221; with a &#8220;cast of sophisticated actors.&#8221;

It&#8217;s the mid-80&#8217;s in a small town in Kentucky. Hair, aerobics and microwaves are all bigâ€¦ and Fern hasn&#8217;t left her house in 6 years. A high-spirited agoraphobic, she is perfectly happy to watch the world go by as she waits for a sign from God telling her to throw open her screen door. With a sister in the midst of an identity crisis, a wacky neighbor with never-ending horror stories, and a drama across the street involving a squalling baby and loud golf pants, hilarity ensues with a surprise gift of some real insight into the human heart.

I play Arnold, whose wife has left him and taken &#8220;every stick of furniture but the crib and the baby in it.&#8221; He knocks on Fern&#8217;s door looking for a baby-sitter, but quickly finds himself caught up in all the household drama.

[&#8220;The View From Here&#8221;](http://www.theviewfromhere.info/) runs Fridays and Saturdays at 8pm, and Sundays at 7pm until June 12th at the [Actors Workout Studio](http://www.actorsworkout.com/), located at [4735 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood, CA 91602](http://goo.gl/maps/IlUI).
