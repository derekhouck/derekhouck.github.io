A while ago, I shot a commercial for the new Sony Bloggie. That commercial is now up on YouTube for all the world to see!

The shoot was entirely improvised, so I had no idea which take was going to eventually be used in the commercial. In the take they chose, I try my best to describe a funny story that happened to my character&#8217;s cat. If you love kittens, I promise there&#8217;s a reward for you at the end of the spot. If cuteness could be weaponized, this would be nuclear-grade plutonium.

This spot is part of a larger &#8220;You Had To Be There&#8221; marketing campaign for the Bloggie. I would love to lay claim to the spot with the most YouTube views of the entire campaign, so if you like what you see, please tell others about it.
