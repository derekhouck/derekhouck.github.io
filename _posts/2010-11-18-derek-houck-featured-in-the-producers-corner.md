I was recently interviewed by Patrick Bardwell of _[Slebisodes Web Series Guide](http://www.slebisodes.com/)_ about producing _[Napoleon Bon Appétit](http://napoleonbonappetit.com/)_. Among the many things he asked was how I began my involvement with the web series. From the interview:

> My best friend, Katherine Browning, came up with the original idea for _Napoleon Bon Appétit_ as a cooking show starring Napoleon Bonaparte. I thought it was hilarious, and decided to write a script for it. Before I knew it, I had 11 episodes written (which we whittled down to seven for our first season) and we began to seriously consider whether we could film this ourselves.

Be sure to read the [full interview](http://www.slebisodes.com/producers-corner/derek-houck.html) to find out more about who inspired me to start self-producing and what lessons I learned while filming _Napoleon Bon Appétit_.
