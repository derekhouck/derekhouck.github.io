[_Standards of Living_](http://standardsoflivingmovie.com/), the new horror film written and directed by Aaron Mento, is now available to watch in its entirety on YouTube.

To enhance his ability to make people laugh, a struggling comedian takes part in a teleportation experiment that &#8220;improves&#8221; whatever cargo is being teleported&#8230;but the results are no laughing matter.

_Standards of Living_ was shot exclusively on the iPad 2.
