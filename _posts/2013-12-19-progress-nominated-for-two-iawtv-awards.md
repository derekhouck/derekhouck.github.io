[PRNewswire &#8211; LOS ANGELES, Dec. 19, 2013](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/progress-nominated-for-two-iawtv-awards-236584981.html) &#8212; [&#8220;Progress,&#8221;](www.ProgressTheSeries.com) the steampunk web series, has received two International Academy of Web Television (IAWTV) Awards nominations in the categories of &#8220;Best Visual Effects (Digital)&#8221; and &#8220;Best Design (Art Direction/Production).&#8221; Three of the scheduled 10 episodes in the series are live on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/ProgressTheSeries).

&#8220;Our nomination confirms a small, independent production company that creates quality programming can compete with extremely well-funded projects like &#8216;Battlestar Gallactica&#8217; and &#8216;Continuum,&#8217; &#8221; said Nicole Wright, series producer and director. &#8220;It&#8217;s an honor just to be nominated among some of the giants in the business, validating our high production values.&#8221;

The visual effects were created by British animator-editor Paul Lada whose credits as an animator include &#8220;Prometheus,&#8221; &#8220;Harry Potter,&#8221; &#8220;Tomb Raider&#8221; and &#8220;Charlotte&#8217;s Web.&#8221; Art Design was a collaborative effort of David King (production design), Shannon Arrant (costumes) and Andrea Garduno (art and illustrations).

&#8220;Progress&#8221; stars Ben Whalen (&#8220;Midnights with Adam,&#8221; &#8220;To Be King&#8221;) as the Sherlockian hacker Oscar Lerwill, Rebecca Lynch (&#8220;Holiday High School Reunion,&#8221; &#8220;Game Night&#8221;) as the alluring cam-harlot Lila DeClide, Derek Houck (&#8220;Community,&#8221; &#8220;United States of Tara&#8221;) as the mischievous troll Adam Rhett, Andy Pandini (&#8220;Between Jupiter and Mars,&#8221; &#8220;Harold&#8217;s Going Stiff&#8221;) as the right-wing pundit Mr. Humbbaugh, Kai Cofer (&#8220;Deadwood,&#8221; &#8220;Smiley Face&#8221;) as the constable Alben Scot, and Anna Mountford (&#8220;Glee,&#8221; &#8220;Murphy&#8217;s Law&#8221;) as the voice of Oscar&#8217;s computer.

&#8220;Progress&#8221; was written by Armando Saldanamora. The series is directed by Nicole Wright and produced by Flawless Victory Media.

The 2014 IAWTV Awards will take place on January 7 at 6 p.m. Pacific Time at the Rio All-Suites Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas and will be live-streamed online.
