The [Glendale News-Press](http://www.glendalenewspress.com/) just posted a glowing review of Beauty and Beast at [Glendale Centre Theatre](http://www.glendalecentretheatre.com/index.php):

> Director Erin Villaverde has developed a fine eye for subtle detail. Gerrard can&#8217;t just sit and listen to the sad tale of Belle&#8217;s father (older pro Mario DiGregorio) â€” he has to sit on his bent over servant, that toady LaPew, (played by Derek Houck with more than a passing resemblance to a younger Wallace Shawn).

I encourage you to [read the full review](http://www.glendalenewspress.com/entertainment/tn-gnp-beauty-20100728,0,823266.story).
