Derek recently went down to [The Kansas City BBQ Company](http://www.thekansascitybbqcompany.com/ "The Kansas City BBQ Company"), where he was interviewed for [KCET&#8217;s Midnight Snack](http://www.kcet.org/socal/food/midnight-snack/midnight-snack-the-kansas-city-bbq-company-with-derek-houck.html "Midnight Snack: The Kansas City BBQ Company with Derek Houck") column. The conversation span a number of topics, from how The Kansas City BBQ Company compares with authentic KC BBQ, to the creation of [Napoleon Bon Appétit](http://napoleonbonappetit.com/ "Napoleon Bon Appétit") and the benefits of moving to a distribution platform like [Blip](http://blip.tv/napoleon-bon-appetit "Napoleon Bon Appétit on Blip"):

> Jason: I tend to not like to watch too many videos on my computer because it&#8217;s a small screen. Whereas now with YouTube you can get it through Xbox and boom, I can watch the whole &#8220;Napoleon Bon Appetit.&#8221; And you&#8217;re right, in high definition and on the big screen, it makes it more enjoyable. I hadn&#8217;t seen the small version, but the flour on the face in the fourth episode was cool.
> 
> Derek: Definitely. That episode benefits greatly from the high definition because a lot of it, a lot of the gag, Napoleon&#8217;s covered in flour and shakes it off at different moments and it helps to see the flour fall off of him. Through Blip and through 20/20 we&#8217;ve been able to get &#8220;Napoleon Bon Appetit&#8221; seen by more people than you&#8217;d ever been able to do before the internet came along. For as little of a budget as we had, the amount of reach that our series can get now is almost unfathomable.
