After 24 action-packed episodes, the end is here for _Cataclysmo and the Time Boys_. And now you can own it in a DVD with an all new feature-length cut of the film as well as special features including filmmakers commentary, deleted scenes, outtakes and bloopers, &#8220;The Making of _Cataclysmo_&#8221; behind-the-scenes featurette, and all 24 of the original web serial episodes. To pre-order the DVD go to [webserials.com](http://www.webserials.com/store/cataclysmodvd.html).

I was featured in [Cataclysmo Episode 8: &#8220;Meanwhile, In the Underwater Lab&#8221;](http://youtube.com/watch?v=WHG-TIvZNq4) as one of two Government Dudes sent to evaluate the latest experiment of the maniacal Dr. Crankshaft. That episode alone was seen by over 21,000 viewers on [YouTube](http://youtube.com/), and was honored as the week&#8217;s #1 Editor&#8217;s Pick &#8211; Entertainment and the #4 Watch on Mobile. This will be the first commercial DVD release of my work, and I am very proud to have been a part of this project.

_Cataclysmo and the Time Boys_ is a weekly web series launched in the summer of 2007. Over the course of 24 episodes, _Cataclysmo_ has received more than 30 honors and been seen by almost 375,000 viewers on YouTube alone.

Along the way, the Time Boys run into the lovely Samantha, the maniacal Dr. Crankshaft, and a terrifying army of wild primates. But will Johnny and Bucky be able to alter the course of time and bend fate itself in order to stop Cataclysmo?
