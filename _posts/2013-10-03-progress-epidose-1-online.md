[Progress](http://progresstheseries.com/), the visually astounding steampunk web series I&#8217;m in, has just released its first episode, entitled &#8220;iAm Involved in Mystery.&#8221;

&#8220;Progress&#8221; is a ten episode web series. Victorian England has a steam-powered internet and Jack the Ripper is posting his crimes on the web. It&#8217;s a Sherlockian cyber-thriller and a game of riddles to decipher the identity of the Whitechapel Murderer.

I portray Adam Rhett, the editor and proprietor of the controversial website &#8220;WikiPunch.&#8221; He&#8217;s a mixture of Julian Assange and the Mad Hatter, a merry prankster who revels in revealing secrets.

I&#8217;m amazed at how beautiful the series turned out, and I hope you enjoy watching it.
