Well, I am definitely sick. And though it is not a surprise, it's still not an ideal
situation. If ever I needed my full mental and physical faculties, it is now.

Yesterday, I sent an email to [Hatch](https://www.hatch.us) letting them know that I had
to pause surrogate matching due to being unemployed. It was one of the hardest emails I
have ever had to write, and it was even more difficult to send. A long and expensive year
of IVF left us with 4 wonderful embryos that are now just waiting for a chance at life.
The biggest motivation I have to find a job soon is them. I am so close to becoming a
father, and yet if feels so far away right now.

I found out this morning that I missed the application deadline to volunteer for [RailsConf](https://railsconf.org/)
by _one day_. With everything going on this past week, the conference had completely
slipped my mind. I have previously attended RailsConf in 2022 and 2023. It was great to
meet other folks working within the same framework that I have made my specialty, and the
conference was a wonderful opportunity to network, learn, and see a city I had never been
to before. This year's conference is in Detroit, very close to where I was born in
Pontiac, Michigan. I hope I get to attend. Anyone interested in sponsoring me? I am more
than willing to let someone cover registration, transportation, and/or lodging to help get
me there.

Today will mostly be spent trying to rest and recuperate as best as I can so I can be at
my best for the [KCXW](https://www.youtube.com/@KCXWWrestlingVideos) taping tomorrow. Talk
to you all soon.
