I woke up with a sore throat and a cough this morning. After taking care of a sick wife,
it was probably the least surprising thing that has happened to me this week. It's still
not ideal though, particularly when I'm expected to be the announcer at a professional
wrestling taping this Sunday.

Yesterday, I had some lovely conversations with lovely lawyers. It will be interesting to
see where those lead.

Yesterday was also the first meeting of my _[Never Search Alone](https://www.phyl.org/)_
Job Search Council since all of this went down. It was gratifying to commiserate with
other people in the same boat, though I wish nothing more than for us all to get jobs and
eliminate the need for us to meet at all. I'm gonna take some time to go through the
_Never Search Alone_ process again from the beginning, just to make sure everything still
lines up with where I'm at right now.

I spent this morning getting a Missouri state inspection on our car so we can finally get
our new title and plates. Then I bought a box for the Volt company laptop and shipped it
back to them. That's the last responsibility I had towards that company. I'd like to think
I behaved professionally throughout the process, all things considered.

It feels like the activity on the LinkedIn post has died down enough that I can turn my
attention back to reflection and figuring out my next steps. While the idea of taking some
time off before I get back into the job search grind sounds very appealing, I have work
search requirements tied to my unemployment check. And even if I didn't, I want another
paycheck as soon as possible so we can resume our surrogacy journey.

Oh, that's right. I have a very difficult email I need to write to [Hatch](https://www.hatch.us) today. I guess I better
get on it. Talk to you all soon.
