[Grigware Talks Theatre](http://www.grigwaretalkstheatre.com/blog.html) has posted a [review of _Something Not Real_](http://www.grigwaretalkstheatre.com/2009/06/review-mini-musical-fest-secret-rose.html). He calls the characters &#8220;an odd and intriguing mix&#8221; and calls out one performer from the show in particular:

> Most promising performers in these mini plays are Jordan T. Maxwell, making a strong impression in Change of Plans and Derek Houck (Something Not Real) and Ian Federgreen (My Jovi), both rendering fast, funny comedic portrayals.

[LA Weekly](http://www.laweekly.com/) has also posted it&#8217;s [review of the show](http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/stage-news/stage-raw-coming-home/) as well, calling it &#8220;ambitious.&#8221;
