<a href="http://progresstheseries.com/" target="_blank"><em>Progress</em></a> has been listed as one of Snobby Robot&#8217;s <a href="http://snobbyrobot.com/2014/01/02/my-five-favorite-series-of-2013/" target="_blank">Five Favorite Series of 2013</a>. From the article:

> Along with its great cast, writing and storyline, PROGRESS also makes an incredible visual impact on viewers through its dazzling special effects and production design – both of which were accomplished on a next to nothing budget. It’s an impressive feat that has earned PROGRESS two IAWTV nominations for both outstanding visual effects and set design&#8230;. Combined with its outstanding group of actors and its intriguing story, PROGRESS is a web series that truly made quite an impression on me – both in style and substance.

_Progress_ is a ten-episode web series. Victorian England has a steam-powered Internet and Jack the Ripper is posting his crimes on the web. The series has been featured in numerous publications, including Wired.com’s GeekMom blog and The Steampunk Tribune.
