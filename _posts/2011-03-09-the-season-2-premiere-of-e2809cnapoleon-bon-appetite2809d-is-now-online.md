Napoleon is back with a new season of &#8220;[Napoleon Bon Appétit](http://napoleonbonappetit.com)!&#8221;

In the season premiere, we go behind the scenes of the show as Napoleon tries to make a valentine for his Kitchen Wench, (played by the series co-creator, [Katherine Browning](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3525058/)) but his  
plans go haywire due to a nosy interviewer ([Heidi Schooler](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0774788/)) and an opportunistic crew member. ([Robert Walters](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1635872/))

Season two will continue every other Wednesday as Napoleon and the Kitchen Wench conquer new recipes and meet new guest stars [Nicolas James](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2184515/), [Rachel Whitman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1728996/), and former &#8220;America&#8217;s Next Top  
Model&#8221; finalist, [Kimberly Leemans](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2138870/). This season also includes the return of [Christine Moore](http://www.christinemoore.net/) as the famous French chef, Louisette Caro!

I hope you enjoy watching season two as much as I enjoyed writing and filming it.
