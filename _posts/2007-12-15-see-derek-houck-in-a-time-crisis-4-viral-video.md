I invite you all to see me in a &#8220;Time Crisis 4&#8221; viral video parodying the film &#8220;Scarface&#8221;. What if Tony Montana was actually a Japanese man equipped with a mythical video game weapon? What if Derek Houck was dressed in 70&#8217;s clothing and given an outrageous mustache? What if the video got distributed on the internet?

The answers to these questions can be found below or on YouTube at this url: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZ3HtwkAJs  


Shakespeare it is not, but at a running time of exactly 43 seconds it has taken you longer to read this e-mail than it would to click the link, watch it, rate it, and send it to all your friends. Which, coincidentally, is exactly what you should do after you finish reading this sentence.
