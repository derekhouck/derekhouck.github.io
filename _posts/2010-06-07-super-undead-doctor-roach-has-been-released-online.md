The superhero short I was in last year, [Super Undead Doctor Roach](http://superundeaddoctorroach.pollystaffle.com/index.html), has been released online for all to see!

Edited, written, produced and directed by Chad Clinton Freeman, Super Undead Doctor Roach is the story of a scientist obsessed with bugs, becoming an accidental super hero. It was originally a seven-minute 48 Hour Film Project produced in April of 2009. The project, edited by Michael Su, was a runner up for the Las Vegas 48 Hour Film Project Audience Award. Doctor Roach was then expanded to its 13-minute length and went on to screen at the Arizona Underground Film Festival in November 2009 and played at the bondage convention Xanadu Las Vegas 2010. Derek Houck (Silent Night, Zombie Night) stars as the short&#8217;s title character and has a supporting cast that features Henry Clarke (S4), Scream Queen guest Rachel Grubb (13 Hours in a Warehouse), as well as Juliane  
Price, Reagan Pfifer, Jason Kelly, Daniel Nagelhout, Laura Moore, Kristine Wright, Ken Kupstis and Miranda Humphrey.
