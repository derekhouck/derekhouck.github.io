[eSteampunk](http://www.efictionmag.com/category/esteampunk/) was given the teaser video for [Progress](http://progresstheseries.com/) as well as scripts for the first four episodes, and wrote a <a href="http://derekhouck.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/esteampunkreview-excerpt.pdf" rel="attachment wp-att-498">review of the teaser (PDF)</a> in their January 2013 issue. Here&#8217;s what they said about Derek Houck as Adam Rhett:

> Derek Houck’s character strikes me as part clown, part chameleon, mostly charlatan. He’s polished and polite. Maybe too much. Lynch shows us this when she backs away from him. Although what he says to her is proper, even polite, it’s the _way_ he says it that repulses her. Something is very wrong here.

You can view the teaser for Progress below. Progress is a ten episode webseries. A Sherlockian cyber-thriller and a game of riddles to decipher the identity of the killer.
