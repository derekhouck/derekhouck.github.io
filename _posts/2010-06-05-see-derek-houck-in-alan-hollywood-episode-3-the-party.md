Episode 3 of Alan Hollywood, entitled &#8220;The Party,&#8221; is now online! When Rick&#8217;s casting director friends don&#8217;t show up to Alan&#8217;s party as promised, Rick gets Alan&#8217;s nerdy friend Craig to pretend to be a casting director.

[Alan Hollywood](http://www.alanhollywood.com/) is a web series about the adventures of a computer programmer named Alan as he settles into his new home in Los Angeles. I play Craig, the socially inept co-worker who must lie about who he is in order to save Alan&#8217;s party. I hope you enjoy, and look for more of Craig in Episode 4!
