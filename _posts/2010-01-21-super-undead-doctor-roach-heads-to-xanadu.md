Just as resilient as any cockroach, Super Undead Doctor Roach just won’t seem to go away.

Edited, produced, written & directed by Chad Clinton Freeman (Killer Biker Chicks), the short was originally a seven-minute 48 Hour Film Project in April of 2009. The film went on to screen at the Arizona Underground Film Festival in November and now makes it way to Vegas.

The 13-minute director’s cut of Super Undead Doctor Roach will screen March 28 at noon at [Xanadu Las Vegas](http://www.xanadulasvegas.com/), which is toting itself as a science fiction, fantasy, horror, fetish and bondage convention for adults only.

Derek Houck (Silent Night, Zombie Night) stars as the short’s title character and has a supporting cast that features Henry Clarke (S4), Scream Queen guest Rachel Grubb (13 Hours in a Warehouse), as well as Juliane Price, Reagan Pfifer, Jason Kelly, Daniel Nagelhout, Laura Moore, Kristine Wright, Ken Kupstis and Miranda Humphrey.
