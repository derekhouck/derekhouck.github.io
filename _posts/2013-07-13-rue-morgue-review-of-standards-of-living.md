[Rue Morgue](http://www.rue-morgue.com/ "Rue Morgue") has reviewed [_Standards of Living_](http://standardsoflivingmovie.com/ "Standards of Living"), calling Derek an &#8220;odd man-boy servant.&#8221; From the [review](http://www.rue-morgue.com/2013/07/blood-on-a-budget-has-an-app-for-that/ "Blood on a Budget has an app for that"):

&#8220;Playing like a superhero-free Grant Morrison comic, the film manages to take an acid-like trip into psycho sci-fi while still respecting its own cracked-out logic.&#8221;

To enhance his ability to make people laugh, a struggling comedian takes part in a teleportation experiment that “improves” whatever cargo is being teleported…but the results are no laughing matter. _Standards of Living_ was shot exclusively on the iPad 2.
