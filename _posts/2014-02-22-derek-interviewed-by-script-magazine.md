Derek Houck, along with [_Progress_](http://www.progresstheseries.com/) producers Nicole Wright and Armando Saldanamora, sat down with writer Rebecca Norris for an [interview in Script Magazine](http://www.scriptmag.com/features/writers-on-the-web-interview-creators-indie-series-award-iawtv-award-nominated-series-progress). When asked about the challenges of playing Adam Rhett, Derek talked about the amount of homework that went into the character:

> &#8220;With Progress, there are so many in-jokes, clues, and references crammed into the dialogue. You can’t just be word-perfect, you must understand the different meanings behind every word, even every syllable, that you utter. In order for Adam Rhett to mock something like the Forever Alone meme, I first had to know what the meme was about. It’s a lot of homework, but it helps create what is, hopefully, a very rich performance that conveys new info each time you watch it.&#8221;
