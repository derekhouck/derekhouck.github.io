Episode 4 of Alan Hollywood, entitled &#8220;About Last Night,&#8221; is now online! The guys and the girls separately talk about the events of the party in the previous episode where Alan and Jill almost kissed and Sherri fell for Alan&#8217;s nerdy friend, Craig, who she thought was a casting director.

[Alan Hollywood](http://www.alanhollywood.com/) is a web series about the adventures of a computer programmer named Alan as he settles into his new home in Los Angeles. I play Craig, the socially inept co-worker who lied to the attractive Sherri, and now must tell her the truth. How will she react? I hope you enjoy!
