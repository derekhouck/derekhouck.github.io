Set your DVRs, because I will appearing on the Season 3 premiere of [United States of Tara on Showtime](http://www.sho.com/site/tara/home.sho) tonight at 10:30pm ET/PT!

In the Season 3 premiere, Tara decides to finish the last few credits she needs to earn her college degree, but Max worries the stress will trigger a transition to one of her alters; Kate tries to plan the next phase of her life; Charmaine is pregnant but still avoids committing to Neil; Marshall and Lionel purchase a video camera together for filmmaking class. I play a waiter in Barnabeez, the seafood restaurant Kate Gregson used to work at.

Executive Produced by Steven Spielberg and created by Diablo Cody, the Academy Award winning writer of Juno, the SHOWTIME Original Series United States of Tara returns for a third season. Suburban wife and mother Tara Gregson (Emmy Award winner Toni Collette) juggles her family and career while suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder â€” a condition formerly known as multiple personality disorder. It&#8217;s never a dull moment in the  
Gregson household, as Tara&#8217;s supportive husband Max and their two teenaged children, Kate and Marshall, try to lead as much of a &#8220;normal&#8221; life as possible.
