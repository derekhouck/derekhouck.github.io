I am proud to announce that I will be back on stage as Gunter in &#8220;Rapunzel&#8221; at the Glendale Centre Theatre. A handsome prince tries to rescue the beautiful Rapunzel from her tiny room atop a tall tower. However, a zany witch, three silly guards, and Rapunzel&#8217;s parents have different plans for her &#8211; that is once they figure out how to get Rapunzel down from the tower! I play Rapunzel&#8217;s father, Gunter, and also serve as the narrator for the audience.

&#8220;Rapunzel&#8221; is the first children&#8217;s show of the 2008 season at GCT, and runs every Saturday morning at 11am from March 1st until June 28th. (No performance on May 24th.) Tickets are $13 for adults and $11.50 for children. For reservations call the Glendale Centre Theatre box office at (818) 244-8481.

I invite you all to come see the show. I guarantee it will be just as enjoyable for adults as it is for children, and with an almost 4 month run there&#8217;s bound to be a performance everyone can attend. I hope to see you there!
