The cooking show with a complex, &#8220;Napoleon Bon Appétit,&#8221; launched today on [Somebody&#8217;s Basement](http://www.somebodysbasement.com/) and [www.NapoleonBonAppetit.com](http://napoleonbonappetit.com/)! In this premiere episode, &#8220;Chicken Cordon Bleu,&#8221; Napoleon stakes his claim to a classic French dish. The Kitchen Wench does her best to restrain the pint-sized dictator, but what will she do when Napoleon discovers an intoxicating ingredient in the recipe?

&#8220;Napoleon Bon Appétit&#8221; features Napoleon (Derek Houck, &#8220;Super Undead Doctor Roach,&#8221; &#8220;Absent&#8221;) and his Kitchen Wench (Katherine Browning, &#8220;The Carpenter&#8221;) as the hosts of their own cooking show. The pair will be serving up a new recipe every two weeks. Writing and producing this series has been one of the greatest  
experiences of my life, and I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed making it.
