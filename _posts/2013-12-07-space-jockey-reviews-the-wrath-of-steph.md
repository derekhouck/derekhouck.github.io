[Space Jockey Reviews](http://spacejockeyreviews.com/) has published is [review of _The 28th Day: The Wrath of Steph_](http://spacejockeyreviews.com/the-28th-day-the-wrath-of-steph/), and they have nothing but praise to haul on both the movie and Derek Houck as Rufus:

> [Derek Houck](http://imdb.derekhouck.com) is a true ‚Äúhoot‚Äù in the truest and most complimentary sense of the word. (Yes, doesn‚Äôt every horror spoof need one of those?) Houck plays the part of Rufus‚Äìan old friend of Dr. Woogie and arm-chair archeologist, longing for the good old days when large-breasted coeds more common than ancient artifacts. Derek Houck is a would-be minor character who brings life to The Wrath of Steph through the boldness of his talent and comedic delivery. He literally steals every scene he‚Äôs in, not just with his appointed dialogue, but, equally so, with the force of his acting; he is in your face as another caricature of a character every time. If ever there was a Space Jockey Reviews nominee for the next SNL regular, Derek Houck is the one! Lorne Michaels, listen up! üòÄ
