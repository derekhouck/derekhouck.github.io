I will be performing in &#8220;Something Not Real&#8221; at the Secret Rose Mini Musical Fest. The festival opens June 19th and runs Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays at 8pm, and Sundays at 2pm until July 5th. There will be no performance July 4th. The Secret Rose Theatre is located at 11246 Magnolia Blvd, North Hollywood, CA 91601, in the NoHo Arts District. Tickets are $20 with a special two for one offer on Thursday. As there are only ten performances call 1-877-620-ROSE (7673) or visit the [Secret Rose Theatre web site](http://www.SecretRose.com) to reserve your tickets today!

&#8220;Something Not Real&#8221; takes place at a party, where two brothers and their wives sing about their misfortunes and their frustrations with life. I play the part of Dicky, an appropriate name for the man who crashes their conversation and serves to only make everyone feel even more uncomfortable. I hope to see you at the show!
