The teaser for the Victorian-era steampunk web series, _Progress_, is now online. Oscar Lerwill is the best hacker of the 19th Century. When he discovers a file posted by Jack the Ripper, Oscar has to find the clues to decode it in order to save his beloved Lila DeClide (the most alluring cam-harlot in [VirtualWhitechapel.com](http://virtualwhitechapel.com/ "VirtualWhitechapel.com")) and avoid the perilous games of Adam Rhett (the mad troll of [WikiPunchProgress.com](http://wikipunchprogress.com/ "WikiPunchProgress.com")).
