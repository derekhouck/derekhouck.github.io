Derek Houck is the cover model and featured interview in the [January issue of La Libertad](http://lalibertadmag.blogspot.com/2014/01/interview-with-derek-houck.html). Derek talks about working on the IAWTV-nominated web series [_Progress_](http://progresstheseries.com/) in a wide-ranging discussion that covers his career and personal life. From the interview:

> **WMV:** What advice, if any, would you give others who are also trying to “make it” in the entertainment industry?
> 
> **Derek: Focus on building a career, not on landing a particular job. Help others out when you can, and they&#8217;ll do the same for you. The only reason I knew about &#8220;Progress&#8221; is because I did a children&#8217;s show with the producer, Nicole Wright, years earlier. I plan to be acting when I&#8217;m seventy, and I want to be able to turn to my co-star and say, &#8220;Remember that student film we did together back in &#8217;07? Before the clone wars and drone pizza delivery? Ah, those were the days.&#8221;** 

Be sure to read the full interview where Derek discusses a wide variety of subjects, including the creation of [_Napoleon Bon Appétit_](http://napoleonbonappetit.com/), which Kansas City is the REAL Kansas City, and why the [_Love That Girl!_](http://tvone.tv/shows/love_that_girl.html) premiere party was called a &#8220;meet and tweet.&#8221;
