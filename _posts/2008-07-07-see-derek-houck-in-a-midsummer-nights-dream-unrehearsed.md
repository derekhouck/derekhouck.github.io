Get ready for what will surely be a unique night of theater. On July 18th & 19th at 8:30pm, I will be in &#8220;A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream&#8230; Unrehearsed&#8221; at Zombie Joe&#8217;s Underground in North Hollywood.

The premise is pretty much what the title implies: We are doing a full production of Shakespeare&#8217;s &#8220;A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream&#8221; without any rehearsals. At 8:30pm on Friday, July 18th, all the actors will stand on the stage and announce to not only the audience but their fellow actors as well what role they are playing in the show. We will then quickly get changed into the appropriate costumes and perform the entire show for the first time as an ensemble.

As mentioned above, the production runs for two nights only: July 18th & 19th at 8:30pm. Tickets are $12 and can be reserved by calling 818-202-4120. Zombie Joe&#8217;s Underground is located at 4850 N. Lankershim Blvd in North Hollywood, across from the KFC.

I invite you all to come to what will hopefully be a funny, original, and entertaining evening. You can go to the web sites for [Zombie Joe&#8217;s Underground](http://www.zombiejoes.com) or [Dollhouse Productions](http://www.dollhouseproductions.com) for more information about the production. I hope to see you there!
