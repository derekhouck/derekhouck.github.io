# About Derek Houck

Hi, I'm Derek Houck. I was raised in Kansas City, Missouri on chocolate, video games, and Kevin Costner films. I remember rooting in vain for the Royals in the awful years before they rebuilt and won the World Series.

## Derek the Developer

I was there for [GeoCities](https://web.archive.org/web/19990210064637/http://www.geocities.com:80/TimesSquare/Arcade/2124/main.html), [table-based layout](https://web.archive.org/web/20020806222926/http://redwhiteandblue.static.nu:80/), [XHTML](https://web.archive.org/web/20050324021948/http://hollywoodcowboy.brightest-star.net/), and [CSS floats](https://web.archive.org/web/20070203124707/http://derekhouck.brightest-star.net/journal/). Nowadays, I specialize in test-driven development using Ruby on Rails and React. I've also built sites and apps running Node.js, WordPress, static site generators, and React Native. I have experience with SQL and NoSQL. I create reliable, well-tested web applications.

I reinvented my career thanks to a coding bootcamp, and I try my best these days to support and mentor those now starting their web dev journeys.

## Derek the Actor

I arrived in Los Angeles in 2003 to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Hollywood and pursue a career as an actor. I had some minor success, appearing in _Community_, _United States of Tara_, and creating my own web series, _Napoleon Bon App√©tit_. If you want, you can revisit my journey as an actor through this [archive of announcements](/blog.html) from the previous iteration of derekhouck.com.

In 2018, I stopped submitting myself for auditions and devoted myself full-time towards web development. I think my history in the entertainment industry has given me a unique ability to communicate clearly with my co-workers, understand the needs of my users, and search for creative solutions to the problems I face in my work. It's also answered the question, "What would Derek look like with antennae glued to his forehead?" You're welcome, America.
