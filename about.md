# About Me

Hi, I'm Derek Houck. I was raised in Kansas City, Missouri on chocolate, video games, and Kevin Costner films. I remember rooting in vain for the Royals in the awful years before they rebuilt and won the World Series.

## Derek the Developer

The first website I ever created was a Mortal Kombat fan community called _Damage's Cave_ back in the days of GeoCities. You can actually still see it on the [Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20001204165600/http://thecave.kcizone.com/).

In the years since, I have had to reinvent myself as a developer several times. I’ve created sites and apps using CSS, WordPress/PHP, Ruby/Rails, Node.js, React, and React Native. I also have experience with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I take great pride in creating sites that are accessible, load quickly, and are device independent.

## Derek the Actor

I arrived in Los Angeles in 2003 to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Hollywood and pursue a career as an actor. I had some minor success, appearing in _Community_, _United States of Tara_, and creating my own web series, _Napoleon Bon Appétit_. If you want, you can revisit my journey as an actor through this [archive of announcements](/blog.html) from the previous iteration of derekhouck.com.

In 2018, I stopped submitting myself for auditions and devoted myself full-time towards web development. I think my history in the entertainment industry has given me a unique ability to communicate clearly with my co-workers, understand the needs of my users, and search for creative solutions to the problems I face in my work. It's also answered the question, "What would Derek look like with antenna glued to his forehead?" You're welcome, America.
