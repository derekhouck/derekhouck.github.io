# Now

I work as a software engineer at [Binti](https://binti.com/). I also volunteer as a mentor for [Techtonica](https://techtonica.org/). And I participate in a weekly online D&D group with former [Bendyworks](https://bendyworks.com/) co-workers as the Light Cleric Callie Goodbarrel.

I have two cats: Dante, a mature tuxedo, and his younger brother, Hazel, an immature tabby.
