# Now

I was laid off from Binti in November and I am currently looking for my next role. In the meantime, I continue to volunteer as a mentor for [Techtonica](https://techtonica.org/).

Also in November, my wife, myself, and our two cats all moved back to Kansas City, Missouri after twenty years in Los Angeles. I'm now unpacking _so many_ boxes and getting reacquainted with the city and its wonderful food.

Speaking of my cats, here's a photo of Dante, a mature tuxedo, and his younger brother, Hazel, an immature tabby.
