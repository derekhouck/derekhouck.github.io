# Now

I currently work remotely as the Internal Technical Support Engineer for [Modern Message](https://www.modernmessage.com/). I also volunteer with a number of groups including [Tech for Campaigns](https://www.techforcampaigns.org/) and [Out in Tech](https://outintech.com/). I still fiddle with a few of the apps featured on my [Projects](/projects) page. I do my best to attend a board game meetup at least once a month.

This page was inspired by the [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/) project.
