# Now

_Last updated on September 9th, 2025_.

I have a new job as a software engineer at [Nava](https://www.navapbc.com/)! I am working on the [CMS Design System](https://design.cms.gov/?theme=core). I look forward to helping other Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services developers create more consistent, accessible, and appealing sites.

Outside of civic tech, I am still the ring announcer for KCXW. _Xcellence_ is coming up on October 11th. Buy your tickets at [kcwrestling.com](https://kcwrestling.com/).

My karaoke league team, the Antici....pations, is gearing up for the finals of the summer vocal league tomorrow. Will we win? Probably not! But we're having fun.

My wife and I are still in Kansas City, Missouri. I eat a lot of BBQ, don't watch Royals game due to an outrageous local TV rights deal, and recently marched in the 2025 KC Pride Parade.
