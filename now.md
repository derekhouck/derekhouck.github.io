# Now

_Last updated on March 6th, 2024_.

On February 26th, I started work as a Product & Software Engineer at [Volt](https://www.textvolt.com). I also continue to volunteer as a mentor for [Techtonica](https://techtonica.org/).

In November of 2023, my wife, myself, and our two cats all moved back to Kansas City, Missouri after twenty years in Los Angeles. I'm still getting reacquainted with the city and its wonderful food.

Speaking of my cats, here's a photo of Dante, a mature tuxedo, and his younger brother, Hazel, an immature tabby.
