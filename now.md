# Now

_Last updated on June 13th, 2025_.

After a year of work, the Forms Engine contract at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has come to an end. Due to several factors, Agile Six has no further work lined up for me and I have been furloughed. I am currently looking for work as a Senior Ruby on Rails Software Engineer. If you know anyone hiring, [send them my way](contact.html).

Meanwhile, I am still the ring announcer for KCXW. _Xtreme Freedom_ is coming up on July 19th. Buy your tickets at [kcwrestling.com](https://kcwrestling.com/).

My wife and I are still in Kansas City, Missouri. I compete in a karaoke league, eat a lot of BBQ, and recently marched in the 2025 KC Pride Parade.
