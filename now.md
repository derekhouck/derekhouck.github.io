# Now

I have joined the [Bendyworks](https://bendyworks.com/) team as a Senior Web Developer. I also volunteer with a number of groups including [Tech for Campaigns](https://www.techforcampaigns.org/) and [Out in Tech](https://outintech.com/). Before the pandemic had us all staying safer at home, I did my best to attend a board game meetup at least once a month.

Our COVID kitten, Dante, is now one year old!
