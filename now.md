# Now

I currently work remotely as a developer for [Community Rewards](https://communityrewards.me/) team at [RealPage](https://www.realpage.com/). I also volunteer with a number of groups including [Tech for Campaigns](https://www.techforcampaigns.org/) and [Out in Tech](https://outintech.com/). Before the pandemic had us all staying safer at home, I did my best to attend a board game meetup at least once a month.

Also, we got ourselves a COVID kitten! Meet Dante:
