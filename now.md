# Now

_Last updated on March 21st, 2024_.

I was let go from [Volt](https://www.textvolt.com/) after less than a month working for the company. You can read more about that over on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/derekhouck_rust-opentowork-activity-7176252664467320834-VF2c).

I decided to go old school and started [blogging](/blog/) about my experience. If you
have an RSS reader, you can subscribe to the [feed](/feed.xml).

In November of 2023, my wife, myself, and our two cats all moved back to Kansas City, Missouri. I'm still getting reacquainted with the city and its wonderful food. Let me know if you have any
recommendations.

Speaking of my cats, here's a photo of Dante, a mature tuxedo, and his younger brother, Hazel, an immature tabby.
