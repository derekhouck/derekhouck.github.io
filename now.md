# Now

_Last updated on April 29th, 2024_.

I recently turned [forty]({% post_url 2024-04-27-forty %}).

I am currently unemployed and looking for work as a Senior Ruby on Rails Software Engineer. I will be attending [RailsConf](https://railsconf.org/) in Detroit next month and I hope to find a new job there.

Meanwhile, I have decided to go old school and started [blogging](/blog/) about my experience. If you
have an RSS reader, you can subscribe to the [feed](/feed.xml).

In November of 2023, my wife, myself, and our two cats all moved back to Kansas City, Missouri. I'm still getting reacquainted with the city and its wonderful food. Let me know if you have any
recommendations.

Speaking of my cats, here's a photo of Dante, a mature tuxedo, and his younger brother, Hazel, an immature tabby.
