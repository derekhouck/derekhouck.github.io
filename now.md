# Now

I work as a software engineer at [Binti](https://binti.com/). I also volunteer as a mentor for [Techtonica](https://techtonica.org/).

In November, I will be moving back to Kansas City, Missouri after twenty years in Los Angeles. I expect to make up for lost time by eating a _lot_ of BBQ.

I have two cats: Dante, a mature tuxedo, and his younger brother, Hazel, an immature tabby.
