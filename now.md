# Now

_Last updated on February 13th, 2025_.

I turned [forty]({% post_url 2024-04-27-forty %}) last year.

I work for [Agile Six](https://agile6.com/) on a contract for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

I am also the ring announcer for [KCXW](https://kcwrestling.com/).

In November of 2023, my wife, myself, and our two cats all moved back to Kansas City, Missouri. I've joined a karaoke league, reconnected with friends and family, and eaten a lot of BBQ.

Speaking of my cats, here's a photo of Dante, a mature tuxedo, and his younger brother, Hazel, an immature tabby.
