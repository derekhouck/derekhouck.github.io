    When I asked Derek to design my site, I didn’t expect that his help would also help me to fine tune my brand. He asked me several questions that I had never thought to ask myself. The specificity and care with which he took in the information about my site’s purpose and its viewership were not only pivotal in creating a successful website, it helped me to articulate my goals for the future.

    He then created a site that looked amazing AND is completely practical for me to manage on my own. We had very few meetings, since he was always ahead of the curve but any notes I gave were taken and then further improved. I just can’t say enough about working with him.

    If you're looking for a dependable, hard working, extremely talented, and a wonderfully witty person to boot, look no further than Derek. 

    I've had the great privilege of working with Derek for almost 3 years at Goldman Marketing Group and if there's one thing I know about him, it's that he's a real winner. Derek faces the toughest problems with great tenacity and will not stop working until there is a solution. His focus on any task he is given is second to none, and is eager to drive results up and up. He also has a great analytical mind that ensures no stone is left unturned to be able to explain any sort of trends in his reporting. 

    Derek also has a great mindset for learning/working with any coding languages or working with API's. He has an established record of project managing our programming team, directly working on complex websites, creating client dashboards, and many other complex systems/solutions. 

    I know Derek will find success in any role or company he chooses to pursue, and be the 'ace in the hole' when a problem arises.

    I had the pleasure of working with Derek in Disney's Environmental Affairs department for over 2 years. Derek is extremely skilled at web programming and digital media, but moreover, he is a reliable, respectful, hard-working contributor and all-around good person. I could always rely on him to meet objectives and goals efficiently, stay flexible when objectives changed, and communicate his needs openly, without drama. I thoroughly enjoyed working with Derek, highly recommend him as an employee and would love to work with him again one day.

    Derek has been very professional and very clear in all communications. Not only is the site to design, the code is very clean and slick. Throughout the entire process he is responsive, and willing to work through issues as they arise. It’s obvious he takes tremendous pride in his work, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend or work with him again.
