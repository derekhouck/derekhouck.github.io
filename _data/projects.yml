- title: VA Digital Form Builder
  slug: form-builder
  description: Utilized the VA's Drupal CMS in a novel way to allow non-technical users to create digital form configurations that could be rendered by a custom React application on VA.gov. I developed much of the content model and normalized Drupal's GraphQL output into a static JSON file that would be interpreted by a new front-end Form Renderer application.
